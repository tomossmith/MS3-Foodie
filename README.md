This is the README file for my Code Institute MS3 project site, Foodie - The Recipe Sharing Site

This project is the 3rd project as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development course. The projects are set in order to demonstrate my understanding of what we have learnt during the previous units.
The task set for this project is to demonstrate the ability to create a fully responsive web application that allows users to interact and manipulate with data stored in a database.

# <span id="#project_goals">Project Goals</span>

*   Design, develop and implement a full stack web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and MongoDB
*   Identify and apply necessary security features


# <span id="#ux">User Experience (UX)</span>

This section is designed to generate possible scenarios of the typical end user that would use this website. 
This will help ensure end user requirements are designed into the website.


## <span id="#ux-user_stories"><b>User Stories</b></span>

* ### <b>User Experience</b>

    - When I visit the site, I want to know that I have landed on the correct site that I intended to visit.

    - I need to be able to navigate to the key elements of the site quickly.

    - The website should load correctly on any device.

    - The website should load quickly and only load the necessary files required to display the key elements of the site first to improve load times.

    - Site visitors should be able to find social links to engage and share recipes to friends through their social media connections.


* ### <b>First Time Visitor Goals</b>

    - First Time Visitors, should be able to understand the purpose and reason for the site.

    - First Time Visitors, should be able to easily find the navigation links.

    - First Time Visitors, should be able to interact with the site upon landing on the site.

    - First time users should be able to view the recipes on the site without having to log in or register for an account.

    - First time users are likely to be un-registered users and must have restricted access to certain areas of the site.

    - First time users are able to navigate the site without registering. However in order to submit a recipe to the site, users must register and therefore the user must be able to locate the Register link on the hompeage easily and quickly.

* ### <b>Returning Visitor Goals</b>

    - A returning visitor would typically be a user that has already registered with the website, therefore the user should be able to locate the log in link easily and quickly on the homepage.

    - A returning visitor should be able to make changes to any recipes they have uploaded onto the site, but must not be able to edit or remove entries entered by the site admin or other users.

* ### <b>Color</b>

    When choosing the most suitable color scheme for the site, I decided to list the main points of what I wanted to try to create from the design.

    Here are the key points to consider when choosing the colors:

    * Eye Catching
    * Comfertable
    * Color Compatibility

    I chose to develop both the logo and the main site theme at the same time to ensure that they could work well together. 
    The colors were going to be an important part of the design in order to create a brand that could be applied throughout the company should it be required in the future.

    To choose a compatible color scheme, I decided to use [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) to find colors that would work well together. 
    I began by choosing a base color that I thought would work well for the brand, then entered the color codes into the site and it came up with other colors that would work well in combination with the colors I had already entered.
