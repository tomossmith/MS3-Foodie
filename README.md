     * ### <b>User Experience</b>

        This section is designed to generate possible scenarios of the typical end user that would use this website. 
        This will help ensure end user requirements are designed into the website.

        - When I visit the site, I want to know that I have landed on the correct site that I intended to visit.

        - I need to be able to navigate to the key elements of the site quickly.

        - The website should load correctly on any device.

    * ### <b>First Time Visitor Goals</b>

        - First time users should be able to view the recipes on the site without having to log in or register for an account.

        - First time users are likely to be un-registered users and must have restricted access to certain areas of the site.

        - First time users are able to navigate the site without registering. However in order to submit a recipe to the site, users must register and therefore the user must be able to locate the Register link on the hompeage easily and quickly.

    * ### <b>Returning Visitor Goals</b>

        - A returning visitor would typically be a user that has already registered with the website, therefore the user should be able to locate the log in link easily and quickly on the homepage.
